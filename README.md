# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Demo

This repository demonstrates how Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) works in web applications. It includes a simple frontend and backend setup to showcase how to handle CORS in a real-world scenario.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the root of the project and run:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Backend
In another terminal, still from the root of the project, run:
```bash
npm run start:backend
```
The backend will start on `http://localhost:5000` and restarts automatically when changes are made to `backend/server.js`.

### 3. Start the Frontend
Still from the root of the project, run:
```bash
npm run start:frontend
```
